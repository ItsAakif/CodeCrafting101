# Day 1: HTML Fundamentals

## Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. It provides a structured way to create and organize content on the web. In Day 1, you learned the basics of HTML. Today, we'll delve deeper into HTML fundamentals to enhance your web development skills.

## Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document has a specific structure that you should follow:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Specifies the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps all HTML content.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title displayed in the browser tab.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.


# HTML Elements and Tags

HTML documents are constructed using elements, represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`). Elements can contain text, other elements, or both. Here are some essential HTML elements:

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Headings of varying sizes.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs of text.
- `<ul>`: Unordered (bulleted) lists.
- `<ol>`: Ordered (numbered) lists.
- `<li>`: List items within `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
- `<a href="URL">Link Text</a>`: Hyperlinks to other web pages.

**Hands-on Activity: Creating a Simple HTML Webpage**

Let's put your knowledge into practice. Follow these steps to create a simple HTML webpage:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text).

2. Copy and paste the HTML structure provided above into your text editor.

3. Add content within the `<body>` element. For example:

```html
<body>
   <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
   <p>This is a simple HTML webpage.</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
       <li>Item 3</li>
   </ul>
   <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
```

4. Save the file with an ".html" extension (e.g., "index.html").

5. Open the saved HTML file in a web browser to see your webpage in action.

Congratulations! You've now created a basic HTML webpage with headings, paragraphs, lists, and a hyperlink. In Day 2, we'll explore links, images, and basic CSS to make your web pages more interactive and visually appealing. Keep up the great work!
